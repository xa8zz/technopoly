## Retro Web Edition (local browser build)

The repository now also ships with a retro-styled web version of Technopoly for quick local play.

### How to launch

1. Open the `web/` folder.
2. Double click `index.html` (or serve the directory with any static web server).
3. The simulation runs entirely in the browser—no additional dependencies or build steps required.

### What’s inside

- **Retro neon interface** with CRT overlays, scanlines, and a synthwave color palette.
- **Quarterly management gameplay** that lets you launch products, run marketing pushes, take loans, and battle rival corporations.
- **AI competitor feed** that narrates opposing moves alongside a live valuation telemetry chart.

Feel free to tweak the HTML/CSS/JS in `web/` to customize the experience or plug it into a more robust frontend workflow.
