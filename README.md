# technopoly

a competitive tech business simulation game with ai competitors, advanced market engines, and customtkinter gui

i'm aware the ui is ugly lol, it's tkinter i don't think there's much to expect

create a company and compete against ai competitors in different markets, create products, develop strategies, and outcompete the AIs
win by having a monopoly (your company has >=70% of the market cap of the stock market) or you're the only company left (you acquired everyone else)

run main.py after installing requirements

will make a better readme at some pt lol
